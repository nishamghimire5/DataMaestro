# LLM Research Findings for CDP Data Cleaning and Standardization

## 1. Research Objectives

This research explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the Customer Data Platform (CDP) for enhanced data cleaning and standardization capabilities.

## 2. Research Deliverables

### 2.1 Identification of Suitable LLM Architectures and Techniques

After evaluating multiple options, **Gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20** was selected for the prototype implementation based on:

- Superior performance on industry benchmarks compared to other freely available models
- Capabilities comparable to premium AI models
- Extensive context window and generous prompt limits
- Cost-effectiveness for the development phase

### 2.2 Development of a Conceptual Framework and Prototype

The conceptual framework has been implemented and is accessible at [https://data-maestro.vercel.app/](https://data-maestro.vercel.app/) under the "CSV Data Processing" section.

The functional prototype in DataMaestro demonstrates LLM integration through:

- **User Interface (`src/components/csv-processing.tsx`):** Central hub for data upload, cleaning instructions, LLM suggestion review/approval, direct command execution, and SQL-like transformations.
- **Supporting AI Flows (`src/ai/flows/`):**
  - `csv-cleaning-suggestions.ts`: LLM (Gemini) analyzes CSV data and user instructions to suggest cleaning actions.
  - `apply-csv-changes.ts`: Applies user-approved suggestions.
  - `csv-direct-commands.ts`: LLM (Gemini/Ollama, with pattern-matching fallback) interprets and executes natural language commands.
  - `csv-direct-processor.ts` & `csv-direct-sql-processor.ts`: Non-AI components for specific, well-defined commands and SQL operations.
  - `data-profiling.ts`: LLMs enhance descriptive summaries and anomaly identification.

This framework enables intuitive interaction with data processing tools, using LLMs to translate human language to data operations.

### 2.3 Evaluation of LLM-Based Approaches

The research evaluated LLM performance against traditional methods:

- **Accuracy:** LLMs (notably Gemini) identify a wider range of data quality issues, including contextual errors and inconsistencies, and handle ambiguous instructions better than traditional rule-based systems.
- **Efficiency:** LLMs automate complex data cleaning and natural language command processing, reducing manual effort and speeding up data preparation.
- **Scalability & Adaptability:** LLM services (e.g., Google AI) are scalable, but performance depends on implementation approach. The current architecture supports small datasets but can be enhanced through:
  - Research into effective data partitioning methods
  - Self-testing AI systems that can validate their own outputs
  - Improved data storage and processing techniques
  - Methods to enhance scalability for larger datasets

The LLM-enhanced module offers a more intuitive, powerful, and flexible solution but requires in-depth research and development to fully realize its potential.

### 2.4 Identification of Challenges and Limitations

Several potential issues were identified during research:

- **Prompt Sensitivity:** LLM output quality depends significantly on instruction clarity. Users may need to:

  - Switch prompting styles to improve clarity
  - Use quotation marks around column names and values
  - Be specific when formulating replace value commands

- **Occasional Inaccuracies:** LLMs may generate incorrect suggestions; human review (as implemented) is essential.

- **Data Volume Limitations:** LLMs have input data limits (context windows), potentially requiring chunking/sampling for very large files, which might affect pattern detection.

- **Computational Costs & Latency:** LLM API use impacts processing time and cost. Model choice (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` vs. larger models, or local Ollama) is a significant factor.

- **Potential Bias:** LLMs can reflect biases from training data; ongoing monitoring is needed.

- **User Interface Considerations:**
  - An undo/redo feature was implemented to mitigate misinterpretation issues
  - Users may need to switch between command and suggestion modes for optimal results
  - Creative approaches to prompting are sometimes necessary to achieve desired outcomes
  - Some complex operations may not work due to implementation constraints

## 3. Recommendations for Implementation and Future Development

Based on research findings, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Leverage Large-Context LLMs:** Utilize models with larger context windows and faster processing capabilities for improved performance.

2. **Research Efficient Data Storage and Context Management:** Develop more effective ways to store data and pass relevant context to LLMs.

3. **Implement Iterative Problem-Solving:** Design systems where LLMs can iteratively solve tasks according to prompts and self-correct errors.

4. **Develop Tool-Using AI Systems:** Create frameworks where AI can trigger SQL or pandas-like tools and iteratively query and solve tasks as required.

5. **Optimize Cost and Token Efficiency:** Find more cost-effective approaches and reduce token usage while maintaining quality results.

6. **Big Data Integration Research:** Investigate methods for applying LLMs to large-scale data processing challenges.

7. **Pre-compute Complex Aggregations:** Use data profiling tools to calculate aggregated values in advance, making them available to the AI when needed.

## 4. Conclusion

The integration of LLMs into the CDP's data cleaning and standardization module shows significant use-case. While challenges exist, particularly around scalability and accuracy, the prototype demonstrates that LLMs can substantially enhance user experience and data processing capabilities through natural language interfaces and intelligent suggestion systems.

Further development should focus on addressing the identified limitations while building upon the successful aspects of the current implementation.
